Real time GNSS reader made for:
- visualisation of the acctual position 
- calulation of mean positions
- generating raport of gained mean positions to the file

INSTRUCTION:
1. Connect Arduino Uno to the computer (or connect GNSS that send position of Base to the COM by UART)
2. Run program to generate GNSS signal on COM (when using Arduino Uno)
3. Run main.py or GNSS_reader.exe to start the program
4. Select right port and baud rate and confirm choice.
5. The program runs right if on graphs is shown actual position, user can get mean values of the measurement, add mean value to table and save data to file.
